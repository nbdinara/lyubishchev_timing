# Lyubishchev Timing App

Lyubishchev Timing is a _simple time-management application_. As a foundation it takes a time-tracking system, developed by Russian-Soviet philosopher and entomologist A.A.Lyubishchev​. The idea is simple: you select an activity that you want and the time-tracker immediately starts. Once you change your activity time-tracker should be also stopped. This app becomes your true mirror: in a small widget it shows how many hours per day were productive, its ruthless reports will tell you if you were good this week, or you simply imitated the activity
